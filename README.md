# last-successful-build-action

This action searches for the last successful workflow-run for the given workflow-name and branch. 
The `sha` of the workflow-commit is set as output-parameter. If no matching workflow exists, the `sha` of the current run is emitted.

## Required Permissions:
The Action requires the permission "read" for the "Actions" scope. This is set by default if you've configured your repositories Workflow permissions to "Read and write permissions". Alternatively you can explicitly set the permissions for the "actions" scope to "read" (see [githubs docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs#overview))

## Usage

```yml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Find matching workflow
        uses: SamhammerAG/last-successful-build-action@v4
        with:
          token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
          branch: "development"
          workflow: "build"
```

## Verifying workflow run SHAs
If your workflow runs are expected to contain no-longer existing commit SHAs (e.g. when squashing and force pushing) you need to verify the SHA of the workflow run commit against the list of commit SHAs in your repository.

```yml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # check out the entire repo history for SHA verification
      - name: Find matching workflow
        uses: SamhammerAG/last-successful-build-action@v4
        with:
          branch: "development"
          workflow: "build"
          verify: true
```
